2. Number of Layers in a mxn matrix = ceil(min(m/2,n/2))
3. Total number of diagonals in a nxn matrix = 2(2n-1)
4. Equation of Main diagonal and its parallel diagonals is given by: |x-y|<=n-1
5. Equation of Off diagonal and its parallel diagonals is given by: 2<=x+y<=2n
6. Rotation of a matrix by 90 clockwise is equivalent to transpose of a matrix and then interchaning i th column with (n-i) th column such that i<=(n-i).
