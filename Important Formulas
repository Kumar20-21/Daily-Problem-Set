1. Number of elements in the i th layer of a mxn matrix =2*(m-i)+2*(n-i)
2. Number of Layers in a mxn matrix = ceil(min(m/2,n/2))
3. Total number of diagonals in a nxn matrix = 2(2n-1)
4. Equation of Main diagonal and its parallel diagonals is given by: |x-y|<=n-1
5. Equation of Off diagonal and its parallel diagonals is given by: 2<=x+y<=2n
6. Rotation of a matrix by 90 clockwise:
    Method 1:
    Transpose the matrix and then interchaning i th column with (n-i) th column such that i<=(n-i).
    Method 2:
    Interchange i th row with (n-i) th row such that i <=(n-i) and then take a transpose of the matrix.
7.  Rotation of a matrix by 90 anti-clockwise:
    Method 1:
    Transpose the matrix and then interchaning i th row with (n-i) th row such that i<=(n-i).
    Method 2:
    Interchange i th column with (n-i) th column such that i <=(n-i) and then take a transpose of the matrix.


8. A Dictionary order first increases and then decreases.
